 ISessionViewer
=============

SessionViewer is a PCAP TCP session reconstructor and viewer with the initial concept/code used from this [codeproject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20501/TCP-Session-Reconstruction-Tool/) article. It has been rewrite numerous times to attempt to use a database as the storage, however, it has proven too slow, even with SQL Server, therefore multiple files are used that are generated with some pre-processing. 

To speed up the display of each session SessionViewer viewer produces a **large** amount of files, three files per session, a binary HEX version, an ascii version and a HTML viewer. The reason being that it reduces the processing when moving from session to session and adds only a minor overhead whilst performing the initial parsing. It also makes colourising of the conversations easier as it both sides of the network traffic.

- Quick view facilities e.g Q key to move up a session, A key to move down a session
- Excel like grid filtering (right click on the session list column headers)
